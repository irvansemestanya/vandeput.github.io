# So Good They Can't Ignore You

So, [Mufid](https://github.com/mufid) lent me a book to read. I took me more than a month to read the book in my dwindling spare time. Finally, after delaying for more time, I have finished the book. This is my note:

Rules:

1. Don't Follow Your Passion

The "follow your passion" advice is dangerous, as not everyone understand what their passion is and also have means to pursue it. Also, the real reason you will love your work is because of the three things elaborated below: skill, control, and mission.

2. Be So Good They Can't Ignore You _(Or, the Importance of Skill)_

3. Turn Down a Promotion _(Or, the Importance of Control)_

4. Think Small, Act Big _(Or, the Importance of Mission)_
