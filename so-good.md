# So Good They Can't Ignore You

So, [Mufid](https://github.com/mufid) lent me a book to read. I took me more than a month to read the book in my dwindling spare time. Finally, after delaying for more time, I have finished the book. This is my note:

Rules:

1. Don't Follow Your Passion

2. Be So Good They Can't Ignore You _(Or, the Importance of Skill)_

3. Turn Down a Promotion _(Or, the Importance of Control)_

4. Think Small, Act Big _(Or, the Importance of Mission)_
