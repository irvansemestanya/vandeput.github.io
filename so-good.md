# So Good They Can't Ignore You

So, [Mufid](https://github.com/mufid) lent me a book to read. It took me more than a month to read the book in my dwindling spare time. Finally, after delaying for more time, I have finished the book. This is my note:

Rules:

## 1. Don't Follow Your Passion

The "follow your passion" advice is dangerous, as not everyone understand what their passion is and also have means to pursue it. The real reason you will love your work is because of the three things elaborated below: skill, control, and mission.

## 2. Be So Good They Can't Ignore You

Rather than asking what the job will offer you, ask yourself what you can offer (the career capital), do you have the rare and valuable skills?

Job that doesn't allow you to use the craftman mindset:

1. Few to no opportunities to distinguish yourself by skills.
2. You think it is useless or perhaps bad for the world.
3. Forces you to work with people you really dislike.

What is the market? Winner-take-all, so only _the quality_ of a specific skill matters. Or auction, _the combination_ of skills are ones that matter.

There will be at least 10 thousand hours before reaching mastery and working hard is not enough. Do _deliberate practice_, stretching yourself over your comfort zone, doing things that are mentally exhaustive and not enjoyable.

## 3. Turn Down a Promotion

## 4. Think Small, Act Big
