# So Good They Can't Ignore You

So, [Mufid](https://github.com/mufid) lent me a book to read. It took me more than a month to read the book in my dwindling spare time. Finally, after delaying for more time, I have finished the book. This is my note:

Rules:

## 1. Don't Follow Your Passion

The "follow your passion" advice is dangerous, as not everyone understand what their passion is and have means to pursue it. The real reason _you will love your work_ is because of the three things elaborated below: skill, control, and mission.

## 2. Be So Good They Can't Ignore You

Rather than asking what the job will offer you, ask yourself _what you can offer_ (the career capital), do you have the rare and valuable skills?

Job that doesn't allow you to use the craftman mindset:

1. Few to no opportunities to distinguish yourself by skills.
2. You think it is useless or perhaps bad for the world.
3. Forces you to work with people you really dislike.

What is the market? Is it winner-take-all market, so only _the quality_ of a specific skill matters. Or auction market, _the combination_ of skills are ones that matter.

There will be at least 10 thousand hours before reaching mastery and working hard is not enough. Tally the _hours of deliberate practice_, stretching yourself over your comfort zone, doing things that are mentally exhaustive and not enjoyable.

## 3. Turn Down a Promotion

To get control over your job, you will need career capital. However, after having enough career capital, you will need to convert it into control. The moment to convert it is decided by _finance viability_, people still willing to pay you even if you ask for more control. 

## 4. Think Small, Act Big

A good mission is waiting in adjacent field of the _cutting edge_. Do little bets to _test the direction_ of your career. Choose the remarkable bet, in _easy to remark_ environment. It can be publication at popular scientific journals, your own tv show in popular channel, or open source software promoted in conferences.
